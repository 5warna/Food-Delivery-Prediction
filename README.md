## Food Delivery Times Prediction

#### Objective

This project predicts the estimated delivery time (in minutes) for food orders based on various features such as distance, weather, traffic level, preparation time, courier experience, and more. It is an end-to-end Machine Learning project with a deployed web app.

This helps optimize delivery operations and improve customer satisfaction.
